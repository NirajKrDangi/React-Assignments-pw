# Assignment README

## Assignment Description 📝

This repository 📦 contains the source code for a web application that implements a login and sign-up form using React. The main goal of this assignment is to create a user-friendly interface for user authentication. The application toggles between the login and sign-up forms and allows users to switch between these two modes.

## Challenges Faced 🤔

During the development of this application, we encountered a few challenges, including:

1. **State Management** 🧩: Managing the state of the application to switch between the login and sign-up forms while maintaining user input data.

2. **Styling** 🎨: Implementing a visually appealing design using CSS, which required careful attention to layout and user interface elements.

3. **React Component Structure** 🧬: Deciding on the structure and organization of React components to make the codebase maintainable and scalable.
